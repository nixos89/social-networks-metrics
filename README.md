# Social Networks Metrics

This repository contains implementation of algorithms calculating centrality metrics for two provided social networks (Karate club and Power Grid) represented as **undirected graphs**.
Implementaion is written in Python 2.7 version and uses [iGraph](https://igraph.org/) library.

Three main metric algorithms are calculating:

1. Eigen Vector centrality
2. Closeness centraility
3. Betweenness centrality
