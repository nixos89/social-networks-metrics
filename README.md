# Social Networks Metrics

This repository contains implementation of algorithms calculating centrality metrics for two (Karate club and Power Grid) provided undirected social networks.
Implementaion is written in Python 2.7 version and uses iGraph library.

Three main metric algorithms are calculating:

1. Eigen Vector centrality
2. Closeness centraility
3. Betweenness centrality

Social networks are represented as graphs.
